===============

Application for dealing with vacation days requests, approvals etc ...

To run this project you need:
- MS Visual Studio 2012 (.NET 4.5);
- IIS 8.0 (or at least 7.0 since it needs WAS, you need also to have non-http activation feature installed since it uses net.tcp binding and .NET4.5);
- access to internet for installing third party frameworks/libraries at first build.
